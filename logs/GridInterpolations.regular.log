1000 interpolations of 6 dimensions with 15 cut points per dimension:
  Rectangle required 0.0024729921629999996 +/- 0.0023239049699276533 sec
  Simplex   required 0.001512492835999999 +/- 0.00798215114325012 sec
How large is the simplex grid speed up over the multilinear grid?
  limiting to 2 dimensions and therefore 316 points per dim:
