┌ Warning: Package RobotOSData does not have FileIO in its dependencies:
│ - If you have RobotOSData checked out for development and have
│   added FileIO as a dependency but haven't updated your primary
│   environment's manifest file, try `Pkg.resolve()`.
│ - Otherwise you may need to report an issue with RobotOSData
└ Loading FileIO into RobotOSData from project dependency, future warnings for RobotOSData are suppressed.
