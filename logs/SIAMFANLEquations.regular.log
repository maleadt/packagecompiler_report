Maximum iterations (maxit) of 3 exceeded
Convergence failure: residual norm too large  1.3169792868987136
Try increasing maxit and checking your function and
                 Jacobian for bugs.
Give the history array a look to see what's happening.
  
The line search failed at iteration 5
Termination with failure
Current values: maxit  =  14, armmax = 5
Give the history array a look to see what's happening.
  
Congratulations, your initial iterate met the teremination criteria.
Residual norm = 0.0 Tolerance = 1.0e-12
  
PTC failure; increase maxit and/or dt0
Residual norm =  0.08793958098385396
Current values: maxit  =  100,  dt0 = 0.1
